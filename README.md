# Handwritten Digit Recognition using Neural Networks

## Dataset:

MNIST is a collection of handwritten digits (0-9) images of size 28 X 28

# Requirements

* Python 3.5 +
* Random
* Numpy
* Matplotlib
* Tensorflow

# Introduction
MNIST contains 70,000 images of handwritten digits: 60,000 for training and 10,000 for testing. The images are grayscale, 28x28 pixels, and centered to reduce preprocessing and get started quicker. 

## Description
This is a Sequential Convolutional Neural Network for digits recognition trained on MNIST dataset. 

## Accuracy
It achieved 99.11% accuracy on training data and 98.11% on test set.
